# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep this organization safe and trustworthy.
We support responsible disclosure and appreciate reports made in good faith.

## Scope

This policy applies to:

- security issues in our repositories
- dependency vulnerabilities or unsafe configurations
- incorrect handling of tokens, secrets, or CI workflows

The following are **not** in scope:

- general bugs that do not pose a security risk
- vulnerabilities in third-party tools or libraries

## How to Report a Vulnerability

Please report security concerns privately using **GitHub's Private Vulnerability Report** feature:

1. Navigate to the repository where the issue exists.
2. Go to **Security** / **Report a vulnerability**.
3. Submit the details privately.

This ensures the issue is not publicly visible while it is being reviewed.

If the repository does not support this feature, you may also open a confidential GitHub Security Advisory draft.

## Response Expectations

We aim to:

- acknowledge receipt of your report within **5 business days**
- provide an initial assessment within **10 business days**
- prepare fixes or further investigation as appropriate

When possible, we will credit reporters for responsible disclosure.

## Safe Harbor

We welcome good-faith security research.
If you follow this policy and do not intentionally cause harm, we are unlikely to pursue legal action.

Thank you for supporting the integrity of our projects.
